## Want to test how quick is your reaction?

#### Single PLayer Mode:

Press the [start] button, a clicking area and a blue circle will appear in the center of your Macbook touchbar. When you see the blue circle turn red, click inside the clicking area! Your resulting reaction time will be shown.

#### Two Player Mode:

Assign each player a side [left, right]. Press the [start] button, two clicking area(one on each side of the touchbar) and a blue circle will appear. When you see the blue circle turn red, click inside your assigned clicking area! The faster reaction wins!

**Note**: ESC key and Macbook touchbar shortcut are still shown/kept when the game is running in case of an emergency. [[source]](https://github.com/yixuanwang/touchBarReact)
