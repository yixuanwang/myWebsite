:lollipop: ”All you need is Hailey”

Roots in China, lived in Canada, Hailey has now reached the Bay. She’s a bundle of energy that lighten the mood around her. Make no mistake, she’s also passionate about tech and will fulfill her duty at work.

 Off work, she’s an aspiring musician; She knows the rhythm of any drums and the melody from the piano. Snacks are her favorite; you’ll catch her munching day and night but you better act fast, if you want any. And if that’s not enough, she’ll never get tired of trying new and exquisite food all around the world.
